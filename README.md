# terpscan

terpscan is an iOS application made for the [UMD Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu) Mailroom to log packages for faculty members digitally. Using an iOS device's camera, barcodes of packages can be scanned efficiently for their tracking number.

# How it is Made
- UI is made primarily using Apple's new [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) framework
- [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata) is utilized to provide persistent storage on-device

# Future Updates
- Integration with [CloudKit](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/) to allow faculty members to access package information from a website with [UMD SSO](https://umd.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0013650)
